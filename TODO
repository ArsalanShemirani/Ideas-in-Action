We need to change from sqlite to mysql.
Work on adding pages to Navbar links. I will start to style later. I just want to be able to navagate using the NAvBar.
BAckend we should lookat how we are going to upload user docs and see which we can and cannot support to print.<-I have no idea how that works lol
Look at the cloudprint documentation and see what we need to configure on the frontend.

Look at creating Adnmin and User accounts and Views with modified access. 
Consider forms needed and DB fields to ease data entry. (are there tools?)
